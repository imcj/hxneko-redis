hxneko-redis was written by Guntur Sarwohadi and modified by Ian
Martins.  It works with Redis version 1.3.


Usage
-----

1. Instantiate an object (it connects immediately)
2. Execute Redis commands by making method calls on that object.

---
import redis.Redis;

static function main()
{
	var db = new Redis("localhost");
	db.set("key1", "value1");
	db.set("key2", "value2");
	trace(db.get("key2"));  // outputs: "value2"
	trace(db.get("key1"));  // outputs: "value1"
}
